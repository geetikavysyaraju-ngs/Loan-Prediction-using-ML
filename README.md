 ## Loan Prediction Model

# Overview

This project predicts loan approval status using machine learning based on applicant details such as income, credit history, and loan amount.

# Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn

# Algorithms

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier

 # Workflow

Data preprocessing → Model training → Evaluation → Prediction

 Evaluation

Models are evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix. Logistic Regression performs better than Decision Tree.

# How to Run
python loan_prediction.py

 # Conclusion

The project demonstrates how machine learning can support accurate and data-driven loan approval decisions.
